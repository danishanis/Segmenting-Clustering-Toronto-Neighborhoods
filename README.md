# Segmenting-Clustering-Toronto-Neighborhoods
Using Web Scraping &amp; Geopy packages with k-Means to perform segmenation &amp; visual clustering

The project includes **scraping the Wikipedia page** for the postal codes of Canada and then **process and clean the data** for the clustering. The clustering is carried out by **K Means** and the clusters are plotted using the Folium Library. All Boroughs of *Toronto* in it are first plotted and then clustered and plotted again.

### Web Scraping Data
Building code to scrape the following [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M), in order to obtain the data that is in the table of postal codes and to transform the data into a pandas dataframe.

## Results
Map of Toronto's Neighborhoods created based on Latitudes & Longitudes
